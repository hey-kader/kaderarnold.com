This is Kader Arnold's online portfolio web app.

## Implementation details 

This website was built using ReactJS, Bootstrap, NodeJS, and Express. 


### Front End

While I usually style my own websites using a stylesheet, I decided to use Bootstrap today because I have never used it before. Bootstrap is a styling css maintained by twitter, and It has a useful api in ReactJS. ReactJS is a javascript framework maintained by facebook.
