This is Kader Arnold's online portfolio web app.

## Implementation details 

This website was built using ReactJS, Bootstrap, NodeJS, and Express. 


### Front End

While I usually style my own websites using a stylesheet, I decided to use Bootstrap today because I have never used it before. Bootstrap is a styling library maintained by twitter, and it has a useful api in ReactJS. ReactJS is a javascript framework maintained by Facebook.

### Back End

The serving script is written using NodeJS. server.js is not included in the repo because it inherently reveals the location of the servers OpenSSL certificate.
